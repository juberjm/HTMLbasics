    <h1>Stratovolcanoes</h1>
    <div style="font-size:large">
        A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of
        hardened lava and tephra.[1] Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with
        a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have
        collapsed summit craters called calderas.

        The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens
        before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having
        high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous
        mafic magma.[2] Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9 mi).[3]
        Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure, built
        up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of volcanoes, in
        contrast to the less common shield volcanoes.[4] Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in
        Indonesia, known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883, and Vesuvius in Italy, whose catastrophic eruption in AD
        79 buried the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives. In modern
        times, Mount St. Helens in Washington State, USA and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines have erupted
        catastrophically, but with fewer deaths.

        The existence of stratovolcanoes on other bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated.[5]
        One possible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars, for example the Zephyria Tholus.[6]
        Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries
        where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, Andes,
        Campania) or another oceanic plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines, Aleutian Islands). The magma
        forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the
        upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab.[7] The
        release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and
        temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths.[8] The water freed from the rock lowers
        the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its
        lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere.
        The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate
        composition. When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the
        stratovolcano.[7]

        The processes that trigger the final eruption remain a matter of research. Possible mechanisms include:[9][10]

        Magma differentiation, in which the lightest, most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water, halogens, and
        sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber. This can dramatically increase
        pressures.[11]

        Fractional crystallization of the magma. When anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma,
        this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid, which can lead to second boiling that causes a gas phase
        (carbon dioxide or water) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures.[12]
        Injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber, which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present. This
        could force volatiles out of solution and lower the density of the cooler magma, both of which increase
        pressure. There is considerable evidence for magma mixing just before many eruptions, including magnesium-rich
        olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim. This is possible only if the lava
        erupted immediately after mixing since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene.[13]
        Progressive melting of the surrounding country rock.[14]
        These internal triggers may be modified by external triggers such as sector collapse, earthquakes, or
        interactions with groundwater. Some of these triggers operate only under limited conditions. For example, sector
        collapse (where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide) can trigger eruption only of a
        very shallow magma chamber. Magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for
        eruptions from deep magma chambers.[14]

        Whatever the precise mechanism, the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof
        of the magma chamber fractures, and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface
        through which to erupt.[citation needed]
